# CityZen

CityZen is a civic issue reporting platform that helps citizens report real-world community problems quickly and routes them to the appropriate authority for action. Using a mobile-first workflow, users can capture photos of issues such as potholes, waste buildup, unsafe electrical conditions, drainage problems, and similar urban hazards, while the platform supports investigation, escalation, moderation, and performance monitoring across the complaint lifecycle.

## 1. Introduction

CityZen is designed to make local problem reporting more accessible, traceable, and accountable. Instead of relying on slow or informal complaint channels, the platform gives citizens a structured way to submit evidence-based complaints with images, location data, and category information. The system then stores the complaint, recommends or routes it to the responsible authority, and supports follow-up actions until the issue is resolved, appealed, or formally moderated.

The project combines a React Native and Expo frontend, a Node.js and Express backend, PostgreSQL via Sequelize, and a FastAPI service for OpenRouter-powered AI detection, recommendation, and text assistance.

## 2. Motivation

Urban problems are often easy to observe but difficult to report effectively. Citizens may not know which authority is responsible, may not have a reliable way to submit evidence, and often receive little visibility into what happens after a complaint is filed. That lack of transparency weakens public trust and slows down response times.

CityZen addresses that gap by creating a single digital workflow for complaint submission, authority handling, and administrative oversight. The platform is intended to reduce friction for citizens, improve operational visibility for responsible agencies, and create a stronger accountability layer through analytics, moderation, appeals, and documented status updates.

## 3. Core Features

- Complaint tracking across statuses such as pending, accepted, in progress, resolved, rejected, and appealed.
- Community participation through upvotes, reporting, and additional evidence submission.
- Appeal handling for rejected complaints.
- Role-based workflows for citizens, authorities, and administrators.
- Moderation system with strikes, permanent bans, and banned-user review.

## 6. As Admin

As an admin, CityZen provides platform-wide oversight and governance capabilities, including the ability to:

- Review complaint volume, status distribution, and operational KPIs.
- Monitor department performance and service health.
- Review reported posts and citizen appeals from a moderation workflow.

## 7. Local Development Setup Guide (Precise and Short)

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm
- Python 3.10+ (for the OpenRouter service)
- PostgreSQL
- Expo Go or a simulator/emulator for mobile testing

### Required environment files

Create or update these files before starting the project:

`frontend/.env`

- `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://<YOUR_LOCAL_IP>:3000`
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENROUTER_API_URL=http://<YOUR_LOCAL_IP>:8001`
- Firebase client keys used by the frontend

`backend/.env`

- `PORT=3000`
- `DATABASE_URL` or the `DB_*` variables
- `JWT_SECRET`
- Firebase admin credentials
- `SUPABASE_URL`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`
- Optional for email OTP: `EMAIL_USER`, `EMAIL_PASS`

`openrouter-service/.env`

- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`

Use your machine's local IP in `frontend/.env` if the app will be opened on a physical phone.

### Install dependencies

```bash
cd backend && npm install
cd ../frontend && npm install
cd ../openrouter-service && python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate && pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the system

On Linux:

```bash
./run-cityzen.sh
```

On Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
.\run-cityzen.ps1
```

If you prefer to run services manually, use three terminals:

```bash
# Terminal 1
cd backend && npm run dev

# Terminal 2
cd frontend && npx expo start

# Terminal 3
cd openrouter-service && source venv/bin/activate && uvicorn openrouter_service:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001
```

## 8. Conclusion

CityZen is positioned as a practical civic technology platform that connects citizens, authorities, and administrators in one complaint management workflow. Its value lies not only in making issue reporting easier, but also in improving transparency, routing accuracy, moderation control, and operational accountability. With image-based reporting, AI-assisted support, appeals, analytics, and role-specific dashboards, the project provides a strong foundation for a modern community issue management system.
